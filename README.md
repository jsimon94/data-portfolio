# Data Analyst Projects
Projects I have done on the side.

## P1: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
Analyzed the Stroop effect using descriptive statistics to provide an intuition about the data, and inferential statistics to draw a conclusion based on the results.

## P2: Investigate Titanic Dataset : Does females who traveled with 1 or more people on the titanic have a higher survival rate than females who traveled alone?
Used NumPy and Pandas to answer that question based on the data and created a report to share the results. Used matplotlib and seaborn to create data visualization.

## P3: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
Chose a region and used data munging techniques to assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.

## P4: Explore and Summarize Data
Investigated a dataset using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, exploring both single variables and relationships between variables
